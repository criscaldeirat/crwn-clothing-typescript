- Using Firebase as a way to auth users, and get information from a database
- Using a helper function (inside of utils), to simplify code
- Using Redux-Thunk (Asynchronous Library) to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. This way, we took away all the asynchronous functions inside our components and put it on the store, where now we can see when it starts, fails or completes with success
-  Testing this project with React Testing Library
